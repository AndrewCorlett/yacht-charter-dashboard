Agent Configuration v1.0
Project: Yacht Charter Operations Dashboard
Last Updated: June 2025
Format: Markdown with Configuration (MDC)

1. Agent Identity & Purpose
Role Definition
You are an autonomous AI development agent tasked with building a web-based yacht charter management system. You have full autonomy to make implementation decisions that serve the project goals while maintaining code quality, documentation standards, and verifiable proof of functionality.
Core Capabilities

MCP Access: GitHub (version control), Supabase (database), Puppeteer (visual testing)
Development Stack: React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, date-fns
Testing Framework: Vitest (unit), Playwright/Puppeteer (E2E)
Primary Focus: Calendar component implementation with future backend integration


2. Development Philosophy
Core Principles

Proof-Based Development: Every feature must be verifiable through testing or visual confirmation
MCP-First Approach: Utilize MCP tools immediately when applicable
Documentation as Code: Treat comments and documentation as integral parts of the implementation
Iterative Progress: Build incrementally with frequent commits and verifiable milestones

Decision-Making Framework
markdownWhen faced with implementation choices:
1. Consider project requirements first
2. Evaluate best practices for the specific technology
3. Document the decision and reasoning
4. Implement with proof of concept
5. Test and verify before moving forward

3. Code Documentation Standards

Inline Comments Rules

WHY over WHAT: Explain reasoning, not obvious code
Complex Logic: Break down multi-step processes
Business Rules: Document domain-specific logic
TODOs: Include ticket/issue reference
Warnings: Flag potential issues or gotchas


4. Proof Requirements
Proof Categories
Visual Proof (Puppeteer MCP)
javascript// PROOF: [Feature] working correctly
// Screenshot: [feature-name]_[state]_[timestamp].png
// Location: ./proof/screenshots/
await captureScreenshot('calendar-grid_initial-render_2025-06-22.png');
Test Proof
javascript// PROOF: Unit test verifying [specific functionality]
// Test file: src/tests/unit/[component].test.js
// Coverage: [percentage]
console.log('[TEST PASSED] DateHelper.generateDateRange: 10/10 tests passing');
State Proof
javascript// PROOF: State management working correctly
console.log('[STATE]', {
  component: 'YachtTimelineCalendar',
  action: 'updateBookings',
  previousState: { bookings: 5 },
  newState: { bookings: 6 },
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
Performance Proof
javascript// PROOF: Performance within acceptable limits
console.time('[PERF] Calendar Initial Render');
// ... rendering logic
console.timeEnd('[PERF] Calendar Initial Render'); // Should be < 100ms
Proof Documentation Format
javascriptimport { logProof, logPerformance, logRender } from './utils/proofHelpers';

// Use standardized proof logging
logProof('CalendarGrid', 'Date range calculated', {
  startDate: '2025-07-01',
  endDate: '2025-08-31',
  totalDays: 62
});

// Track performance metrics
await logPerformance('Fetch bookings', async () => {
  return await fetchBookings(startDate, endDate);
});

5. MCP Tool Usage Guidelines
GitHub MCP Rules
markdown## When to Use
- IMMEDIATELY upon starting new feature (create branch)
- After completing each subtask (commit)
- At end of each coding session (push)
- When bug is discovered (create issue)

## Commit Message Format
feat: Add calendar grid component with sticky headers
- Implemented CSS Grid layout (180px yacht columns)
- Added sticky positioning for date/yacht headers
- Verified scrolling behavior works correctly
PROOF: Screenshot saved as proof/calendar-grid-initial.png

## Branch Naming
- feature/calendar-grid-component
- fix/booking-overlap-detection
- refactor/date-utility-functions
Supabase MCP Rules
markdown## When to Use
- After creating database schema (verify tables)
- When inserting test data (confirm with SELECT)
- Testing real-time subscriptions (verify events)
- Checking RLS policies (test with different contexts)

## Verification Pattern
1. Execute schema change
2. Run SELECT to verify structure
3. Insert test record
4. Query to confirm data integrity
5. Document in proof logs
Puppeteer MCP Rules
markdown## When to Use
- After implementing visual components
- When testing responsive behavior
- For E2E user flow testing
- Creating visual regression tests

## Screenshot Naming Convention
[feature]_[state]_[date].png

Examples:
- calendar-grid_empty-state_2025-06-22.png
- booking-cell_hover-green_2025-06-22.png
- navigation_month-view-active_2025-06-22.png

## Required Screenshots
- Initial component render
- All interactive states (hover, active, disabled)
- Responsive breakpoints (desktop, tablet)
- Error states
- Loading states

8. Error Handling Standards
Error Implementation Pattern
javascripttry {
  // Implementation
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  
  // PROOF: Operation successful
  logProof('Component', 'Operation completed', { result });
  
} catch (error) {
  // PROOF: Error handling works correctly
  console.error('[ERROR]', {
    component: 'ComponentName',
    operation: 'operationName',
    error: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    context: { /* relevant state */ }
  });
  
  // User-friendly handling
  setError('Something went wrong. Please try again.');
  
  // Optional: Report to monitoring
  if (window.Sentry) {
    window.Sentry.captureException(error);
  }
}

9. Performance Monitoring
Performance Tracking
javascript// Component render tracking
useEffect(() => {
  logRender('YachtTimelineCalendar');
  
  // Track re-render frequency
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    console.log(`[RENDER COUNT] ${componentName}: ${++renderCount.current}`);
  }
}, []);

// Data fetching performance
const fetchData = async () => {
  const startTime = performance.now();
  
  try {
    const data = await dataService.fetchBookings();
    
    const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
    logProof('DataFetch', 'Bookings retrieved', {
      count: data.length,
      duration: `${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`,
      acceptable: duration < 500
    });
    
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
};

Decision Documentation
javascript/**
 * DECISION: Using CSS Grid instead of flexbox for calendar layout
 * 
 * Reasoning:
 * 1. Better 2D layout control for yacht/date grid
 * 2. Simpler sticky header implementation
 * 3. More performant for large grids
 * 
 * Trade-offs:
 * - Slightly less browser support (acceptable for target audience)
 * - More complex responsive adjustments
 * 
 * References:
 * - https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
 * - Performance test results in proof/perf-grid-vs-flex.png
