# Session 3: Sticky Header Fix Implementation
**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY (100%)

## Session Overview
This session focused on resolving a critical user experience issue where the yacht names header row was scrolling with the calendar content instead of remaining fixed and visible. The goal was to implement a proper sticky header solution and verify its functionality through comprehensive testing.

## Problem Statement
The yacht timeline calendar had a scrolling issue where:
- Yacht names header (Spectre, Disk Drive, Arriva, Zambada, Melba So, Swansea) scrolled with content
- Users lost visibility of yacht names when scrolling through calendar dates
- Grid alignment needed to be maintained between header and content

## Technical Analysis
### Initial Investigation
- Examined `YachtTimelineCalendar.jsx` component structure
- Identified that sticky headers were implemented within the scrollable container
- Found that `position: sticky` within a scrolling parent wasn't working as expected

### Root Cause
The yacht names header was inside the scrollable area (`#calendar-scroll-area`) with `sticky top-0`, but the sticky positioning was relative to the scrolling container, causing it to scroll with the content.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Structural Reorganization
**File Modified:** `/src/components/calendar/YachtTimelineCalendar.jsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Extracted yacht names header from scrollable container
- Created dedicated fixed header section outside scroll area
- Maintained identical grid structure for perfect alignment

### 2. Technical Implementation Details
```jsx
// Before: Header inside scroll container
<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto" id="calendar-scroll-area">
  <div className="grid w-full" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(7, 1fr)' }}>
    {/* Sticky headers that weren't working */}
    <div className="sticky top-0 z-30">Date</div>
    {/* Yacht headers */}
    {/* Calendar content */}
  </div>
</div>

// After: Separate fixed header + scrollable content
<div className="border-b border-gray-300 flex-shrink-0 bg-white" 
     style={{ position: 'sticky', top: '0', zIndex: 40 }}>
  <div className="grid w-full" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(7, 1fr)' }}>
    {/* Fixed yacht headers */}
  </div>
</div>

<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto" id="calendar-scroll-area">
  <div className="grid w-full" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(7, 1fr)' }}>
    {/* Scrollable calendar content only */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Key Technical Decisions
- **Positioning:** Used `position: sticky, top: 0` on container outside scroll area
- **Z-Index:** Set `zIndex: 40` to ensure header stays above content
- **Background:** Added white background to prevent content bleed-through
- **Grid Consistency:** Maintained identical `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(7, 1fr)'` for perfect alignment

## Testing & Verification

### 1. Automated Puppeteer Testing
**Created:** `test-sticky-header.js`
- Automated screenshot capture before/after scrolling
- Grid alignment verification
- Yacht name visibility testing
- Performance assessment
