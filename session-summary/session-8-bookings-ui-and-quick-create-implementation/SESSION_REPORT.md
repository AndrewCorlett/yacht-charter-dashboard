})

// Enhanced Input Handling
const handleInputChange = (e) => {
  // Auto-uppercase postcode for UK compliance
  if (name === 'postcode') {
    processedValue = value.toUpperCase()
  }
  // Clear validation errors on user input
  // Maintain form state consistency
}
```

### Navigation Integration
```jsx
// MainDashboard Routing
const renderMainContent = () => {
  switch (activeSection) {
    case 'bookings':
      if (currentView === 'panel' && selectedBooking) {
        return <BookingPanel booking={selectedBooking} />
      }
