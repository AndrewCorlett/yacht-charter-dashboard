# Session 10: File Upload Implementation & Supabase Integration
**Date:** June 26, 2025  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY (100%)

## Executive Summary
This session delivered two major enhancements: a comprehensive file upload system for crew experience documents and complete Supabase database integration. The implementation transformed the crew experience section from basic form fields to professional document management while establishing a robust backend foundation for the yacht charter dashboard.

## Problem Statement
The yacht charter dashboard required:
- **File Upload Capability** - Replace crew experience dropdown/textarea with PDF/Word document upload
- **Database Integration** - Connect to Supabase for persistent data storage
- **Document Management** - Professional file handling with validation and preview
- **Backend Foundation** - Establish database schema and connection for future development

## Solution Approach

### 1. Crew Experience File Upload System
**Complete Form Transformation**
- Replaced dropdown + textarea with sophisticated file upload component
- PDF and Word document support (.pdf, .doc, .docx)
- Drag-and-drop functionality with visual feedback
- File validation, preview, and management capabilities
- Seamless integration with existing unsaved changes tracking

**Industry Standard Implementation**
- File type validation with MIME type checking
- Configurable size limits (10MB default)
- Professional error handling and user feedback
- Consistent dark theme styling
- Mobile-responsive design

### 2. Supabase Database Integration
**Complete Backend Setup**
- Extracted credentials from Errlian codebase
- Configured Supabase client with singleton pattern
- Created comprehensive database schema for yacht charter operations
- Established helper functions for CRUD operations
- Verified connection and prepared for real-time functionality

**Production-Ready Architecture**
- Row Level Security enabled
- Proper indexing for performance
- Trigger-based timestamp management
- Scalable table structure supporting complex booking workflows

## Technical Implementation

### File Upload Component Architecture
```jsx
// FileUpload Component Features
- File type validation (PDF/Word only)
- Drag & drop support with visual feedback
- File preview with type-specific icons
- View, remove, and replace functionality
- Loading states and error handling
- Integration with form state management

// BookingPanel Integration
const handleFileUpload = (fileInfo) => {
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    crewExperienceFile: fileInfo
  }))
}

<FileUpload
  title="Crew Experience"
  description="Upload crew experience document (PDF or Word)"
  acceptedTypes=".pdf,.doc,.docx"
  maxSize={10 * 1024 * 1024}
  onFileUpload={handleFileUpload}
  currentFile={formData.crewExperienceFile}
/>
```

### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Yacht Charter Specific Tables
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    booking_number TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    yacht_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES yachts(id),
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(id),
    charter_type charter_type NOT NULL DEFAULT 'bareboat',
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    -- Status tracking fields
    booking_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    deposit_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    contract_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    -- Crew experience file support
    crew_experience_file_name TEXT,
    crew_experience_file_url TEXT,
    crew_experience_file_size INTEGER,
    -- Additional booking data...
);
```

### Supabase Client Configuration
```javascript
// Singleton pattern with optimized settings
export const supabase = (() => {
  if (!supabaseInstance) {
    supabaseInstance = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
      auth: {
        autoRefreshToken: true,
        persistSession: true,
        detectSessionInUrl: true,
        storage: window?.localStorage
      },
      realtime: {
        params: { eventsPerSecond: 10 }
      }
    })
  }
  return supabaseInstance
})()

// Database helper functions
export const db = {
  async getBookings() { /* CRUD operations */ },
  async createBooking(booking) { /* ... */ },
  subscribeToBookings(callback) { /* Real-time */ }
}
```
